    the command 'git log -p' will spit out all of the diffs from the commit history. this could MAYBE eventually be useful if i wanted to script patches based on the diffs to show the various stages that the patch project underwent during development. but for now, the git log is adding '+' symbols to the start of every line in the patcher json code, which might make it just really annoying to deal with for now

    moved the commit logs into a /logs folder. need to make sure the max 'text' object knows to look for this in its search path

    this patch is just to get things started -- i didn't want to commit to having a named patch without knowing its function. but, lets make sure that i don't use subpatches as much as possible so that the gource animation can be verbose
